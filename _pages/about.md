I'm a Masters Candidate in Stanford's [Design](http://designimpact.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} program, with a focus on using data science and human-centered design to create equitable healthcare outcomes. I'm currently researching in the [Human Computer Interaction(HCI)](https://hci.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} group under [James Landay](https://www.landay.org/){:target="_blank"} on building physical and digital adaptations that enhance sustainability and human well-being.

This summer, I will be joining [Overjet](https://www.overjet.ai/){:target="_blank"} as a Data Scientist to help them in their mission of transforming dental care using AI.

Before this,I worked in the information, communication and technology for development (ICTD) space in West Africa, particularly in Sierra Leone and Liberia on projects in the **healthcare**, **open government** and **financial
inclusion** sectors.
